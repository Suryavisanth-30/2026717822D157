# University Enrollment System

## Description
This Java program, "UniversityEnrollmentSystem," facilitates managing student, course, and faculty data in a university system through JDBC interactions with a MySQL database.
It allows adding students, courses, and faculty, enrolling/unenrolling students in/from courses, assigning faculty to courses, and removing courses. 
The program's core functionality revolves around SQL queries for CRUD operations on tables representing students, courses, faculty, and their relationships.
It ensures data integrity through foreign key constraints and handles user input through a simple console-based menu system.
